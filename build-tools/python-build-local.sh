#This helper script will package the Python project in
# webapp-python, build it locally, package it as a zip
# file for Lambda, and upload that zip file to an S3 bucket.
#
#Prerequisites:
# 1. Python 3.6 available locally.
# 2. Local environment MUST be a recent version of Amazon Linux.
# 3. Credentials available in local environment that can write
#    to the specified S3 bucket.
#
#Usage:
# ./python-build-remote.sh $BUCKET_NAME
#
#Output:
#You will see all of the normal output from the commands
# that this script runs. You can mostly ignore these. The only
# output that is necessary is the final S3 ListObjectVersions
# JSON that shows you the new VersionId of the uploaded
# file in S3.
