#This helper script will package the Python project in
# webapp-python, send it to a remote server, build it
# there, package it as a zip file for Lambda, and download
# that zip file back to this host.
#
#Prerequisites:
# 1. Python 3 available locally.
# 2. SSH-accessible EC2 instance running Amazon Linux
#   NOTE: This needs to be a recent version of Amazon Linux,
#    so I recommend just creating a new instance for this
#    workshop.
# 3. SSH key that grants access to above host.
#
#Usage:
# ./python-build-remote.sh $HOST_NAME $SSH_KEY
#
#Output:
#You will see all of the normal output from the commands
# that this script runs both on your local system and on
# the remote host. You can mostly ignore these.
