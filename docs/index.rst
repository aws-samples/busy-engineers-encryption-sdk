A Busy Engineer's Guide to the AWS Encryption SDK
#################################################

In this workshop, you will add encryption and decryption features to a simple web application that
sends form data over `Amazon SQS`_.

First, you will set up a work environment for this workshop. Then you will start adding functionality to the application.
This functionality will include basic changes to enable encrypting and decrypting arbitrary data; using KMS directly
for encryption and decryption; and using the AWS Encryption SDK. We will also walk you through using features
such as `Encryption Context`_ and Data Key Caching.

Getting started
***************

For help setting up an environment to work through the exercises, see :ref:`Environment Setup`.

For some tips on how to debug your application if needed, see :ref:`Debugging Tips`.

When you are done experimenting, you can find instructions for cleaning up the application in :ref:`Cleaning up`.

List of exercises
*****************

* :ref:`Exercise 1` - Explore the example application and make your first change
* :ref:`Exercise 2` - Add KMS encryption to the example application
* :ref:`Exercise 3` - Add encryption using the AWS Encryption SDK
* :ref:`Exercise 4` - Add caching to the example application

Bonus Tasks
***********

If you want more challenging tasks, try these ideas:

* Downloading the `AWS Encryption SDK CLI`_ and using it to decrypt some of your messages.

* The AWS Encryption SDK supports encrypting the same message with multiple keys. Try encrypting with two KMS
  keys in different regions. Make sure you can decrypt in each region independently.

* Write your own `Cryptographic Materials Manager`_ (CMM) to transform the incoming request. For example, write one
  that adds a timestamp to the Encryption Context. Using the material introduced in Exercise 4, experiment with how the
  timestamp affects caching behavior and performance.
